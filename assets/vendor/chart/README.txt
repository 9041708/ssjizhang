Place Chart.js UMD build here for local hosting:

Recommended file name:
- chart.umd.min.js

Get it from:
- https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/releases (download dist)
- Or copy from jsDelivr: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js

Once placed, dashboard will prefer local script automatically.
